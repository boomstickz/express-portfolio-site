# express portfolio site

this project is my express.js + ejs portfolio assignment.  
it keeps the same maroon helvetica aesthetic from my original static site but now runs with express, ejs templates, and bootstrap.

## features
- built with express.js using ejs templating  
- four routes: `/`, `/about`, `/projects`, `/contact`  
- shared header/footer partials across all pages  
- public folder for css, images, and scripts  
- responsive bootstrap layout + font-awesome icons  
- deployed to render (live link below)
